Welcome to NEXT's documentation!
================================

What is NEXT?
----------------
NEXT is an framework to test adaptive learning algorithms and provide real world
results.

What NEXT does
-----------------
Finds the "best" element in a set. This could be the "best" caption, the "best"
resume, the "best" image, etc. It does this by asking users to compare two
objects at a time.

In general, this can be broadened to any adaptive learning algorithm. This
process is described more in :ref:`development`.
